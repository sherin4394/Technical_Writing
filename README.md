The basic idea of Agile methodology is the continuous delivery of working software in iterations. In Scrum, one of the Agile methodologies, the software is delivered in time-boxed iterations called `Sprint`. Each sprint focuses on one goal and lasts for a one- to two-week period. The Scrum project team comprises three roles, they are `development team members, product owner, and scrum master`.
<br/> As per Monday.com, in 2021, 86% of software development teams used Agile methodologies to create their products. However, 46% of businesses are struggling in establishing consistent Agile practices which prevent them from accessing the benefits of Agile. Hence, Agile meetings termed as ceremonies play a vital role in ensuring the process quality and product improvement. 
<br/> The Agile ceremonies are four events that happen during each Scrum sprint. As defined by Monday.com, Agile ceremonies are meetings with defined length, frequencies, and goals. The purpose of ceremonies is to plan, track and engage the clients with their work and deliver it with increased efficiency.
