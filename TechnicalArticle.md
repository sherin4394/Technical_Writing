# Agile Ceremonies
## Introduction
Agile is a collection of principles used in software development and project management. Agile helps teams to focus and deliver the tasks efficiently, thus delivering value to the stakeholders.
<br/> The following figure depicts the flow diagram of the `Agile-Scrum Framework`.

The basic idea of Agile methodology is the continuous delivery of working software in iterations. In Scrum, one of the Agile methodologies, the software is delivered in time-boxed iterations called `Sprint`. Each sprint focuses on one goal and lasts for a one- to two-week period. The Scrum project team comprises three roles, they are `development team members, product owner, and scrum master`.
<br/> As per Monday.com, in 2021, 86% of software development teams used Agile methodologies to create their products. However, 46% of businesses are struggling in establishing consistent Agile practices which prevent them from accessing the benefits of Agile. Hence, Agile meetings termed as ceremonies play a vital role in ensuring the process quality and product improvement. 
<br/> The `Agile ceremonies` are four events that happen during each Scrum sprint. As defined by Monday.com, 
> Agile ceremonies are meetings with defined length, frequencies, and goals.
> 
>> The purpose of ceremonies is to plan, track and engage the clients with their work and deliver it with increased efficiency.

## Types of Agile Ceremonies
The following block diagram depicts the four Agile ceremonies and their purposes.

Following are the Agile ceremonies:
<br/> **1.	Sprint Planning**
<br/> The Sprint Planning meeting happens at the beginning of a sprint. In this meeting, the team is assigned work from the product backlog, which contains a list of prioritized tasks. Each task is discussed with the team members and they collectively decide on the estimated time required for each task. The team creates a Sprint backlog which contains the list of tasks to be implemented during the current Sprint.
<br/> **Purpose:** Determine which backlog item will be handled in the next sprint 
<br/> **Participants:** Development team members, product owner, and scrum master
<br/> **Duration:** Usually one hour for a one-week sprint, two hours for a two-week sprint, and so on
<br/> _**Note:** The product owner, development team, and the stakeholder prioritize the tasks in the product backlog before the sprint planning. This is an ongoing process known as backlog refinement._ 

<br/> **2.	Daily Stand-up**
<br/> The Daily Stand-up meeting is held at the same time. This meeting helps the team members to discuss and monitor their progress to achieve the sprint goal. In this meeting, each team member provides the highlights of tasks completed the previous day, planned tasks for the day, and any issues or risks that deter them, their team, or the delivery. 
<br/> **Purpose:** Provide the status update of the tasks assigned to each member and solution to time-consuming issues
<br/> **Participants:** Development team members, product owner, and scrum master
<br/> **Duration:** 15 minutes 

<br/> **3.	Sprint Review**
<br/> The Sprint Review meeting is conducted at the end of every sprint. It is advised to conduct regular Sprint review meetings (in most cases two weeks). The team can also set the next sprint goals and highlight the possible risks and issues in this meeting. This is the time for the team to celebrate their accomplishments. 
<br/> **Purpose:** Demonstrate the tasks completed so far and get feedback from the stakeholders, which is used for making improvements
<br/> **Participants:** Development team members, product owner, scrum master, and project stakeholder (optional)
<br/> **Duration:** one hour (For example, two-hour review following a two-week sprint)
<br/> _**Note:** The work should be fully demonstrable and meet the quality standards set by the team. The feedback received from the stakeholders can be used to modify the product backlog._

<br/> **4.	Sprint Retrospective**
<br/> The Sprint Retrospective meeting happens at the end of every sprint. This meeting helps to develop, deliver or manage complex projects.
<br/> **Purpose:** Discuss what went well in the current sprint and identify areas of improvement for the next sprint
<br/> **Participants:** Development team members, product owner, and scrum master
<br/> **Duration:** Differs from team to team, minimum 15 minutes to 45 minutes for a one-week Sprint 

## Conclusion
Agile ceremonies help in facilitating communication between the team members and stakeholders. These ceremonies ensure that all the team members contribute equally to improving the quality of the product. 
<br/> Regular interactions between development teams, product owners, stakeholders, and clients help in understanding the requirements, identifying the risk or issues, and delivering a product that meets the qualitative standards of the stakeholders and clients.
